# BayMax6

## Overview

BayMax6 is a hands-on project aimed at learning how to build a multimodal chat application. This project is all about integrating different AI models to handle audio, images, and PDFs in a single chat interface. It's a great way for anyone interested in AI and software development to get practical experience with these technologies.

## Features

- **Quantized Model Integration**: This app uses what are called "quantized models." These are special because they are designed to work well on regular consumer hardware, like the kind most of us have at home or in our offices. Normally, the original versions of these models are really big and need more powerful computers to run them. But quantized models are optimized to be smaller and more efficient, without losing much performance. This means you can use this app and its features without needing a super powerful computer.

- **Image Chatting with LLaVA**: The app integrates LLaVA for image processing, which is essentially a fine-tuned LLaMA model equipped to understand image embeddings. These embeddings are generated using a CLIP model, making LLaVA function like a pipeline that brings together advanced text and image understanding. With LLaVA, the chat experience becomes more interactive and engaging, especially when it comes to handling and conversing about visual content.

## Possible Improvements
- ~~Add Model Caching.~~
- ~~Add Images and Audio to Chat History Saving and Loading.~~
- ~~Use a Database to Save the Chat History.~~
- Integrate Ollama, OpenAI, Gemini, or Other Model Providers.
- Add Image Generator Model.
- Authentication Mechanism.
- Change Theme.
- Separate Frontend and Backend Code for Better Deployment.
